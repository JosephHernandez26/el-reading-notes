# **Hash Tables For the People**

## **What the heck is a Hash Table anyway?...Sounds illegal**

### **Hash Tables**

- In computing, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### **Ok, then what is hashing?**

- Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.

### **What are Hash Tables used for?**

1. **Hash Tables** are used to store and retrieve hash values.

### **Important Terms You Should Know**

1. **Hash**
   - How you determine an index of the array.
