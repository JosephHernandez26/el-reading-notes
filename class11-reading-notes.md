**Why is access control important?**

Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems.

**Describe an application that would need access control.**

Access control is a fundamental component of data security that dictates whoâ€™s allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data. Access control can also be applied to limit physical access to campuses, buildings, rooms, and data centers.
