### El Questions

#### 1. Describe a use case for a serverless function.

- So, say I write this function right, and I want it to be used for this one specific purpose and for nothing else and THEN I host it on this big cloud computing site. Eh, eh? Whatayathink?

#### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

- First, I would hire a software engineer, that's a big one. Then I would make sure they used events that had attached listeners (sockets if you will), and these little baddies would get triggered and carry out a specific function, or something like that.

#### Describe how a CDN works.

- A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed. By caching content physically close to where a user is and reducing the distance it has to travel, latency is reduced. This process also decreases stress on origin servers by distributing the load geographically across multiple servers.

**Cloud Storage**

> Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company.
