### El Questions

#### Review, Research, and Discussion

##### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

- The client will make a related subject matter query *or* a request to the server using those lovely RESTful methods we all enjoy (`GET` `POST` `PATCH` and `DELETE`).

- The sever follows up with a response containing all the requested information, provided that object actually exists within the annals of the Database.

##### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC.

- A thing is done, then another thing, and you get the all the things you asked for in the end, or something.

- No, but for realsies, the dub-double-arr-sea takes in the request from the client, it performs all the magical necessary actions that are necessary to render a response. Boom! 

##### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

- This is when you put all your cards on the table for the public to judge you and the working (hopefully) version of your code being hosted like an out-of-town guest.
- If you want the textbook stuff here ya go, don't say I never gave you anything:

  - Software deployment refers to the process of making the application work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment or a user's computer or mobile device. Software deployment includes all of the steps, processes, and activities that are required to make a software system or update available to its intended users.
