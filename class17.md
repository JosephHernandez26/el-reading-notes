### El Questions

#### 1. Describe “The Cloud”.

- The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. Most cloud services can be accessed through a Web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome, and some companies offer dedicated mobile apps.

#### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

- Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object. Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes, ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments, regardless of environment.

#### What is auto-scaling?

- Auto-scaling happens when resources (such as server storage) automatically increases or decreases to meet the demand of the clients. This is neat, if you are a fortune 500 company and you don't much care or you need it to auto-scale, not so much for us broke bootcamp students.

#### What is bandwidth?

- Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps). [The Source of Knowledge](https://www.verizon.com/info/definitions/bandwidth/)

#### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

- When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

##### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Server Instances**

> A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately.

**Cloud Services**

> The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.

**Cloud Architecture**

> Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.

**AWS**

> Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**

> TL;DR: The 30-thousand-foot comparison of these, Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, solutions (production configurations) is that they have comparable features and pricing. One big difference is that Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve.
