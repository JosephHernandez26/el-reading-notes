### El Questions

#### Review, Research, and Discussion

##### Write the following steps in the correct order

1. Register your application to get a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party.

3. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint.

4. Receive access token.

5. Receive authorization code.

6. Make a request to the access token endpoint.

7. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint.

##### What can you do with an authorization code?

An authorization code can be exchanged for an access token which will grant the user access to the website.

##### What can you do with an access token?

The Access Token allows users to access restricted or protected areas and websites.

##### What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

OAuth is a service and it allows apps to obtain secure access to multiple sites using (typically) the user's email as authentication.

##### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Client ID**

> A client ID is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients

**Client Secret**

> A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. Protect your client secrets and never include them in mobile or browser-based apps.

**Authentication Endpoint**

> Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service. The approach is also known as device authentication.

**Access Token Endpoint**

> The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user.

**API Endpoint**

> The “endpoint” of an API is simply a unique URL that represents an object or collection of objects.

**Authorization Code**

> An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

[Source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorization-code.asp#:~:text=An%20authorization%20code%20is%20an,into%20a%20security%2Dprotected%20space.)

**Access Token**

> Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API.
