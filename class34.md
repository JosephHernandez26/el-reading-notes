### **El Questions**

1. **How do bearer tokens work?**
   - The *Bearer Token* is created by the Authentication Server.
   - When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server goes and generates a token.
   - **Bearer Tokens** are the predominant type of access token used with **OAuth 2.0**.

2. **Describe express middleware**
   - Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server.
   - Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to.
   - This “chaining” of middleware allows you to compartmentalize your code and create reusable middleware.

3. **What is a JWT?**
   - *JSON Web Token* - **JWT** is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
   - **JWT**s can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.
