## **GRAPHS**

### **Some Things You Should Know...**

#### **What is a Graph?**

- A non-linear data structure that holds a collection of *Nodes* connected by *Edges*.
- Graphs are represented through *Adjacency Matrixes* or *Adjacency Lists*.

#### **How Do You Traverse A Graph?**

- Graphs are traversed in much the same manner as Trees.
- They use the exact same methods for traversal:
  1. **Breadth First**
  2. **Depth First**

### **Graphs in the Wild**

1. **Facebook** or I guess *Meta*.
2. **Google Maps**
3. **The Internet** for real though!
4. **Everyday Stuff**
   - Let's be real, you use graphs all the time, think about it.

### **Some Essential Vocabulary**

1. **Vertex**
   - Essentially, this is a Node that is >= 0.
2. **Edge**
   - The Edge links one Node to the next.
3. **Neighbor**
   - The adjacent Node.
4. **Degree**
   - Determined by the number of Edges that are connected to a given Node.
5. **Adjacency Matrix**
   - A 2-dimensional array similar in appearance to a chessboard with 1's and 0's rather than black and white squares.
6. **Adjacency List**
   - A common method for showing graphs displaying the relational connection between Nodes.
   - Additionally, Adjacency Lists are used to link the **weights** to the Node.
7. **Weighted Graphs**
   - A graph with numbers assigned to Edges or *'weights'*.
   - **When using a matrix**
     - The weights are used rather than 1's.
