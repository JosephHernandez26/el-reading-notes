- Through testing each individual event using unit tests.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**FIFO Queue**

> A FIFO queue is a queue that operates on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the request (like a customer in a store or a print job sent to a printer) is processed in the order in which it arrives.

**Pub/Sub**

> Pub means 'publish,' in event driven programming, to emit an event, is to publish it for the server and clients to hear (subscribe to).
> Sub means 'subscribe, and this happens when the server and/or clients are listening for a published event, they are 'subscribed.'
