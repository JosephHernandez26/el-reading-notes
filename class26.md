#### **What is the difference between a framework and a library?** 

- A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.
- A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by sub-classing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.

### **Document the following Vocabulary Terms**

1. **Rendering**:
   1. Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. [The Source](https://github.com/scottie-l/reading-notes/blob/main/reading-notes-401/seobility.net/en/wiki/Rendering)
2. **Templates**:
   1. A template is a chunk of HTML that you need to inject onto the page. Often templates are created “server side” – in that they come to the JavaScript fully formed and just need to be put into the DOM.[The Source](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/127-basics-of-javascript-templating/#:~:text=A%20template%20is%20a%20chunk,be%20put%20into%20the%20DOM.&text=In%20that%20case%20having%20the%20template%20right%20in%20JavaScript%20is%20ideal.)
3. **State**:
   1. State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component’s current situation. It’s managed in the component just like any variable declared in a function.
